# Hospitality_Analysis

**About the Project**
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the Indian hospitality industry for the past two decades, With multiple five-star hotels across India.
However, the management noticed a decline in market share and revenue in 
the luxury/business hotels categories. The managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
AtliQ Grands does not have an in-house data analytics team. Therefore, they plan to hire a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide insights.

**Key Insights:**
✅ Regardless of the season, The hotel maintains a uniform pricing strategy throughout the entire year, commonly referred to as ADR.
✅ There is a correlation between Average Rating & occupancy % (i.e more the rating more the occupancy % and vice versa)
✅ High-rated properties like Atliq City, Atliq Bay, and Atliq Blu in Hyderabad offer lower ADR, challenging the usual relationship between rating and price.
✅ Even though Hyderabad and Bangalore share nearly the same occupancy percentages and average ratings. Bangalore charges a higher ADR for the same room category than Hyderabad.
✅ It's worth noting that, among the four cities, room categories in Bangalore consistently receive the lowest ratings compared to the others, even though they offer identical rooms across all locations.

**Recommendation:**
✅ Reconsider pricing policy (ADR) for Hyderabad's Atliq Bay, Atliq Blu, and Atliq City.
✅ Focus on improving average ratings to drive higher occupancy rates, leveraging insights by analyzing top-rated properties within the same category across cities.
✅ Can Implement Dynamic Pricing: by charging higher rates during peak demand periods and offering discounts during low-demand periods.
✅ To increase booking from direct platforms can offer exclusive packages that are only available through direct booking channels.
